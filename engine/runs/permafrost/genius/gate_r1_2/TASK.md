# Task: kill test - find the one number that decides whether each idea lives

QUESTION: Russia holds vast natural resources (oil, gas, metals, diamonds, coal, rare earths) in Siberia, Yakutia and the Arctic, mostly under permafrost and far from roads, railways and ports. Propose a fundamentally new way to reach, extract, process or bring these resources to market that is extremely cheap (several times cheaper than current practice), has never been tried or seriously costed by anyone, can be deployed within a few years, and works with known physics. Not incremental improvements of existing mining, drilling, pipelines or winter-road logistics.

Below are 6 candidate ideas. You are a screening engineer with tools: WebSearch/WebFetch and Bash with python3.
For EACH idea, spend about 3 minutes and do exactly two checks, with real numbers in python and a source for every
decisive input. Do not improve or redesign the ideas; judge them as written. Work only in `/home/user/SomeRepository/engine/runs/permafrost/genius/gate_r1_2/`: read no other
files in the repository, write files only there, do not commit.

1. KILLER: the single quantity most likely to kill the idea at the scale it needs (a rate, flux, force, energy
   balance, recovery, strength, tolerance-vs-drift over the operating time, or a site condition that must hold).
   Compute what is REQUIRED and what is AVAILABLE (measured data, physical limits). MARGIN = available / required
   (1 = just works, 0.1 = fails by 10x, 5 = five times headroom).
2. CHAIN: cost per unit of product delivered to market (per oz, per t of metal, per t of coal, per t LCE, per boe)
   with the idea, against the BEST current practice a competent operator would use, over the whole chain (not one
   link). Use the ledger below for the current cost structure. RATIO = current cost / cost with the idea.

Value ledger (data):
ARCHETYPE A: seasonal open-cut placer: dozers/rippers strip frozen overburden, sluice washing plants, diesel via summer sea/river plus winter road, gold flown to refinery | delivered cost ~6,900 rub/g = ~$2,550/oz (Susumanzoloto 2025 RAS ~6,200 rub/g, escalated) | price $4,150/oz
SHARES (est.): energy 10% | labour/camp 20% | inbound logistics 12% | outbound logistics 0.2% | processing (spares, repairs, contractors, washing) 20% | capital 15% | other 22% (MET 6% + 10% of price above $1,900 = $474/oz)
LARGEST: other (MET/taxes) - a 10x cut of it removes 20% of delivered cost. Earthmoving frozen ground (diesel ~11 l/g, fleet, operators) is ~2/3 physically.
ARCHETYPE B: Baimskaya design: 70 Mt/yr Cu-Au open pit + flotation, floating-NPP power, 5,000-bed FIFO camp, 1.4 Mt/yr concentrate trucked 428 km to own Arctic port, then NSR (Jul-Nov) to China | delivered cost ~$8,500/t Cu CIF China gross, ~$2,500 net of 490 koz/yr gold (est.) | price Cu $13,980/t (LME, 31 Jul 2026), Au $4,150/oz
SHARES (est.): energy 11% | labour/camp 11% | inbound logistics 3% | outbound logistics 5% | processing 15% (2026 TC/RC benchmark $0) | capital 41% ($8.5bn BFS capex) | other 14%
LARGEST: capital - a 10x cut of it removes 37% of delivered cost.
ARCHETYPE C: export: open pit + wash plant, then RZD ~2,000 km to Vanino/Vostochny (Elga's own 531-km railway + Okhotsk port: ~$12/t vs ~$46/t, est.); settlements: small pit (Zyryanka, Dzhebariki-Khaya), then river/river-sea barge plus winter-road last mile | delivered cost export ~$83/t FOB; settlement ~23,000 rub/t (~$275/t) at the boiler (est.) | price $106/t FOB Vostochny, 5,500 kcal (Sep 2026); settlement: subsidised
SHARES (est., export / settlement): energy 5/3% | labour/camp 10/4% | inbound logistics 4/1.5% | outbound logistics 55/85% | processing 11/3% | capital 11/2% | other 4/1.5%
LARGEST: outbound logistics - a 10x cut of it removes 50% (export) / 76% (settlement) of delivered cost.
ARCHETYPE D: Kolmozerskoye design: open-pit spodumene pegmatite (1.96 Mt ore/yr), DMS/flotation concentrate, chemical plant making 45 kt/yr Li2CO3/LiOH. Brine alternative: DLE on 169-383 mg/L oilfield brine (INK, since Apr 2026, costs undisclosed) | delivered cost ~$10,200/t LCE (est.) | price $19,750/t Li2CO3 CIF Asia (2 Sep 2026)
SHARES (est.): energy 9% | labour/camp 14% | inbound logistics 4% | outbound logistics 1.5% | processing 18% | capital 42% (91 bn rub capex + 40 bn rub road) | other 12%
LARGEST: capital - a 10x cut of it removes 38% of delivered cost.
ARCHETYPE E: 0.2 Mt/yr East-Siberian field: early-production facility, associated-gas power, crude trucked ~300 km by winter/all-season road to ESPO, Transneft to Kozmino | delivered cost ~$82/bbl FOB Kozmino (est.) | price ESPO ~$100/bbl (Brent $106 on 12 Oct 2026; ESPO near Brent parity)
SHARES (est.): energy 1% | labour/camp 6% | inbound logistics 2% | outbound logistics 20% (trucking $10 + ESPO tariff $6/bbl) | processing 5% | capital 13% | other 53% (MET+NDD ~$43/bbl; full Sep-2026 MET 38,312 rub/t = $62/bbl)
LARGEST: other (fiscal take) - a 10x cut of it removes 48% of delivered cost (largest physical term: outbound, 10x removes 18%).
CROSS-CUTTING:
- Diesel (84 RUB/USD): exchange price 77k rub/t (~65 rub/l, Jun 2026); Yakutia retail 123 rub/l (Oct 2026); remote sites 120-150 rub/l ($1.4-1.8/l, est.), about half of it logistics.
- Power: Sakhaenergo isolated-grid tariffs 80-362 rub/kWh (2024); mine-scale diesel ~41 rub/kWh ($0.49, est.); Baimskaya's floating NPP 6.45 rub/kWh (2020 prices); grid hook-up expected to cut Nezhda TCC ~$40/oz.
- Freight: winter road ~20 rub/t-km ($0.24); LORP river barge ~8,000 rub/t per seasonal haul (~3-5 rub/t-km, est.); NSR general cargo Arkhangelsk-Pevek 15-17k rub/t; RZD coal tariff ~61% of FOB (Kuzbass); ESPO pipe ~3,750 rub/t (est.).
- FIFO labour: wages Chukotka 261k, Magadan 214k rub/month (May 2026); fully loaded ~5 M rub (~$60k) per worker-year (est.), ~2 workers per post.
- Construction premium: Far North builds cost 2-3x central Russia; Baimskaya capex is $28k per annual t Cu ($44k including state road/port/NPP, 1.1 trn rub) vs $22.4k global: 1.3-2x.

VERDICT: ALIVE if MARGIN >= 1 and RATIO >= 1.5; DEAD if MARGIN < 0.3 or RATIO < 1.1; otherwise WOUNDED.
Be strict and fair: a beautiful idea that fails by 10x is DEAD; a dull idea with headroom is ALIVE.

Final answer (text only), exactly this format, one block per idea in the order given:

IDEA 1: <name>
KILLER | <quantity> | required <value unit> | available <value unit> (<source>) | MARGIN <number>
CHAIN | <best current practice> | now <cost unit> | with idea <cost unit> | RATIO <number>

(same for the other ideas)

THE 6 IDEAS:
IDEA 1
NAME: Wintering Miner-Barge Boilerhouses
MECHANISM: A barge carrying a packaged coal boiler cuts 5,000-8,000 t from a riverbank seam into its own hold, sails up to 1,500 km to a settlement and freezes into a backwater as the village boilerhouse, piped to the heat network; in spring it returns to the seam. Bunker level and heat demand are logged to size the next season's cut. Deciding quantity: river distance to the nearest coal bluff, now up to ~1,500 km instead of 100 km; it has headroom because transshipment, stockpiles, the winter road and the boilerhouse building all disappear, leaving only barge freight at 3-5 rub/t-km.
VALUE: Nearly every river settlement gets coal at roughly half today's logistics cost.

IDEA 2
NAME: River-Stripped Terrace Gold Barge
MECHANISM: Large rivers such as the Aldan and Indigirka undercut frozen gold-bearing terraces, collapsing metres of bank each summer and washing the silty overburden away while the gold settles at the toe. A barge with an excavator and wash plant works that waterline toe, taking only the basal pay the river has exposed, and moves along as slices fall. The grade of each bank segment is stored, so the barge returns where the retreating bank reaches new pay. Deciding quantity: pay exposed per km of bank per year (retreat × pay thickness); it has headroom because the river, not diesel, does the stripping.
VALUE: Placer gold is mined without stripping, roads or a winter fuel haul, removing over half of delivered cost.

IDEA 3
NAME: Flooded Kimberlite Pit Brine
MECHANISM: Worked-out kimberlite pits in western Yakutia, up to ~600 m deep, are left to fill with the Cambrian brines their mines used to pump away. The dense brine stays liquid under any ice, so floating direct-lithium-extraction modules work the lake year-round and return stripped brine to its deep end. Density and lithium profiles are logged, and the intake follows the richest layer. Deciding quantity: lithium stored in the pit lake (0.1 km³ at 100-300 mg/L holds 50-150 kt LCE); it has headroom because the hole, grid power, roads and town already exist.
VALUE: Lithium carbonate is produced without a mine, concentrator or new road, removing most of the 42% capital share.

IDEA 4
NAME: Robot-Milled Summer Peat
MECHANISM: Beside a settlement, an autonomous tractor mills peat as it thaws through the summer, turns it under 20-hour sun in dry continental air and ridges it into stacks for a grate boiler. A stored field map of moisture and yield per strip schedules milling around forecast rain. Deciding quantity: field-dried yield per hectare per season, 50-100 t at 40-45% moisture in Nordic practice; it has headroom because a settlement burning 3,000 t of coal a year needs only ~130 ha, and peat lies within a few km of most northern villages.
VALUE: Settlements with no coal nearby get local fuel, removing most of the 85% logistics share.

IDEA 5
NAME: Robot Pillar Robbing
MECHANISM: Soviet underground placer mines in Kolyma and Yakutia left pillars of their richest pay inside frozen drifts. Robots enter through old shafts or a new borehole, laser-scan the workings against archived plans, cut the pillars on retreat and let the roof cave behind them, sending the gravel to a portable wash plant; the grade of each pillar is stored and re-ranks the rest. Deciding quantity: gold per m³ handled, 3-10 g in pillars against ~0.3 g per m³ moved in open cut; it has headroom because the overburden and development were paid for decades ago.
VALUE: Gold that is already proven and opened up is recovered with 10-30x less material moved per gram, in workings where caving rules out human miners.

IDEA 6
NAME: Crewless Micro-Placer Nomads
MECHANISM: Soviet drill lines have already outlined thousands of small placers holding 10-100 kg of gold each, too small to support a camp. A self-propelled robotic set (excavator, sluice and fuel sled) arrives by winter road, strips and washes one placer per season without people, regrades it and moves on. The grams from each block are stored to correct the archived reserves of the next target. Deciding quantity: the cost of finding ore, now near zero because the drill archive replaces geophysics; it has headroom because the targets are already proven.
VALUE: Orphan placers become worth mining, with labour, camp and camp supply (about 30% of delivered cost) removed.
