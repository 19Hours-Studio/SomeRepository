# Task: kill test - find the one number that decides whether each idea lives

QUESTION: Propose a new architecture for an AI accelerator chip, named "Continuum", that could credibly be called the best in the world. The asker has not said which workloads count: training, inference, or both. They have not said what "best" is measured by, or which kind of target (data center, edge, or other) the chip is for. A good answer therefore has to state its own target workloads and metrics, then defend the architecture against the current leading designs. Those designs include GPUs such as the Nvidia Rubin class, Google TPUs such as Ironwood, and SRAM-centric dataflow chips such as Cerebras WSE-3 and Groq LPU. The architecture should cover compute, memory hierarchy, interconnect, numerics, programming model, packaging and power. It should cite known physical, economic and manufacturing limits, and say what would need to be true for it to work. Reported 2026 reference points are listed in CONTEXT. Many are vendor or blog figures, and the sources disagree on some numbers.

Below are 4 candidate ideas. You are a screening engineer with tools: WebSearch (WebFetch may not reach hosts; use
search excerpts) and Bash with python3 (pip install from PyPI works). Do not improve or redesign the ideas; judge them
as written. Work only in `/home/user/SomeRepository/engine/runs/meta_ab/gate/c2/`: write files only there, do not commit.

For EACH idea, spend about 3 minutes:
1. KILLER: the single quantity most likely to kill the idea at the scale it needs (a rate, a memory or bandwidth
   budget, an error or quality loss, a strength, a tolerance over the operating time, a condition that must hold).
   Compute what is REQUIRED and what is AVAILABLE from measured data or exact arithmetic, with a source for each
   decisive input. If the quantity can be measured by running code, measure it, after checking the measurement once
   on a case with a known answer. MARGIN = available / required (1 = just works, 0.1 = fails by 10x, 5 = five times
   headroom).
2. CHAIN: the gain the question asks for (cost, memory, speed, error per unit of the final product or service) with
   the idea, against the BEST current practice a competent practitioner would use, over the whole system rather than
   one part. Use the ledger below for the current structure. RATIO = current / with the idea (larger is better).
Ground every decisive input in a source or a measurement, not in the idea's own text.

Notes from the user and about the environment (data; the user may be wrong):
(none)

Value ledger (data):
Some shares below are my own estimates built from sourced anchors. Each is marked "est."

**ARCHETYPE A:** Data-center inference of a large MoE model (GLM, DeepSeek or Kimi class) on owned GB200 NVL72 racks with disaggregated prefill/decode serving. | cost about $0.04–0.08 per million tokens at 85–195 tok/s/user (SemiAnalysis InferenceX, owning-hyperscaler TCO model) | rental price $1.86 per chip-hr for GB200 NVL72 (SemiAnalysis, July 2026)
SHARES (est., from the capex split plus an electricity share of TCO): accelerator silicon, HBM and packaging 8 | accelerator vendor margin 28 | CPU, server and other hardware 8 | network 11 | facility power, cooling and building 20 | electricity 15 | ops and software 5 | other (taxes, land, fees) 5
Anchors for these shares:
- Bernstein puts GPUs at 39% of a roughly $35B/GW build, networking at 13%, and mechanical/electrical plus building at about one third.
- Epoch puts B200 BOM at about $6.4k against a $30–40k price.
- Electricity is about 15–30% of owned-cluster cost per GPU-hour at $0.12–0.14/kWh.
LARGEST: vendor margin on the accelerator, 28%. A 10x cut removes 25% of the cost. Facility power, cooling and building (20%) is the largest term that physical design can change. A 10x cut of that removes 18%.

**ARCHETYPE B:** Frontier pretraining on a rented or owned GPU cluster (H100/B200 class), with FP8/BF16 mixed precision and large 3D-parallel runs. | cost about $30–40M per run for GPT-4 and Gemini Ultra (Epoch, 2023 era). A third-party dashboard on Epoch data says frontier runs have grown about 10x since. Epoch's trend is 2.4x per year, with runs above $1B expected by 2027. | no price or target
SHARES (Epoch ranges, midpoints normalized to 100): accelerator chips and servers 44 | cluster networking 13 (Epoch adds 23% overhead for it) | R&D staff including equity 33 | energy 4 | other (facility, cloud margin, failed runs) 6
Epoch's raw ranges are hardware 47–67%, staff 29–49% and energy 2–6%.
LARGEST: accelerator hardware, 44%. A 10x cut removes about 40%. Staff cost (33%) does not fall when chips get cheaper, so it caps what a better chip can save.

**ARCHETYPE C:** Long-context decode on HBM GPUs (GQA model, batch-limited, KV cache streamed from HBM every step). | cost about 107 mJ/token at 4K context and 242 mJ/token at 16K (arXiv 2605.11999, a measurement study) | no target
SHARES (est.; no source gives this breakdown): HBM streaming of weights and KV cache 50 | tensor-core compute 15 | static, idle and uncore power 18 | scale-up and scale-out interconnect 7 | cooling and power-conversion overhead 5 | other (workload-fixed algorithmic minimum) 5
Source support is qualitative:
- Decode is memory-bound.
- Off-chip DRAM access costs 100–1000x the energy of an on-chip FLOP.
- Energy per token rises 2.26x from 4K to 16K context because the KV cache grows.
- One measurement found H100 reaching only 27% of peak HBM bandwidth on this workload, so the simple bandwidth model is not exact.
LARGEST: HBM data movement, about 50% (est.). A 10x cut removes about 45%. This is the term an architecture can attack most directly.

**ARCHETYPE D:** Manufacturing one flagship accelerator: B200-class, TSMC 4NP logic dies, 8 HBM3E stacks, CoWoS-L packaging. | cost about $6,400 per chip (Epoch range $5.7–7.3k; Silicon Analysts $6.75k) | price $30–40k, an estimated 82–84% chip-level gross margin
SHARES of BOM: HBM 45 (about $2,900) | advanced packaging 17 (about $1,100) | logic dies, substrate, test and other 33 (est., the remainder) | other (yield loss, royalties, fees) 5 (est.)
Note that CoWoS capacity is a supply limit as well as a cost. Silicon Analysts projects 120–130k wafers per month by end-2026, up from 13k at end-2023. Figures for B200 packaging cost are about 47% above H100 (Silicon Analysts).
LARGEST: HBM, 45%. A 10x cut removes about 40%. HBM plus packaging is roughly two thirds of BOM.

**Reading across the four archetypes (my synthesis):**
- Memory and packaging dominate chip BOM (D).
- Memory movement dominates decode energy (C).
- Chip margin plus facility power and cooling dominate inference TCO (A).
- Chips are about 45% of training cost, and staff cost is a floor that chips cannot reduce (B).
- A new chip can move A through C, but it cannot touch staff cost or the margin of whoever sells the chip.

**Caveats:**
- Sources disagree. Rental and TCO figures are vendor or blog numbers.
- Cloudrift and Spheron differ by about 2.5x on depreciation per GPU-hour because of node-versus-GPU unit confusion, so I did not use either as a direct input.
- The Bernstein, Morgan Stanley and Epoch capex splits use different definitions. GPU share runs from 39% up to about 60%.
- I found no measured breakdown of decode energy by component. The C shares are my estimates and should be checked before use.
- I did not look at edge workloads. The archetypes are all data-center.

Ceilings computed from the ledger (data):
Target: 3x cheaper. Ceiling = 1 / (share no engineering can touch: taxes, royalties, fees, margins). 'needs' = the fewest cost terms that must each fall 10x to reach the target.

VERDICT: ALIVE if MARGIN >= 1 and RATIO >= 1.5; DEAD if MARGIN < 0.3 or RATIO < 1.1; otherwise WOUNDED.
Be strict and fair: a beautiful idea that fails by 10x is DEAD; a dull idea with headroom is ALIVE.

THE 4 IDEAS:
IDEA 1
NAME: Attention Inside HBM Base-Die
MECHANISM: Each HBM4 stack's logic base die stores its share of the KV cache and runs two steps locally: approximate top-k block retrieval, then exact flash-decoding partial attention. Only small partial results (softmax numerators, denominators and max values) leave the stack, not the KV data itself. A retrieval index in the base die is updated as tokens are appended. The die adjusts how many blocks it selects based on the entropy of the attention scores.
VALUE: Million-token decode no longer needs to pull KV bandwidth off the stack, which cuts long-context attention energy by roughly an order of magnitude.

IDEA 2
NAME: Attention Inside the Memory Stack
MECHANISM: Logic on the base die of each HBM stack keeps a learned locality-sensitive hash index over the KV cache stored in that stack. For every query, it scores keys locally and returns only the top-k keys and values, or a partial softmax result, to the compute die. The index is updated as tokens are appended and is retuned per model from attention statistics.
VALUE: Long-context decode no longer depends on HBM-to-compute bandwidth, which could cut attention data movement by more than 10×.

IDEA 3
NAME: Retrieval-native HBM base die
MECHANISM: Each HBM4 stack's logic base die stores a 1–2-bit sketch of every key. For each decode query it runs an approximate top-k search beside the DRAM. Only the selected K/V rows cross to the compute die. The value of k adapts per head from observed attention entropy.
VALUE: Long-context decode traffic falls by an estimated 10–50×, so million-token contexts cost roughly what short ones do today.

IDEA 4
NAME: Optical weight broadcast fabric
MECHANISM: Each package holds 1/16 of the expert weights. Weights are read from HBM once and sent through passive 1:16 optical splitters to 16 packages at the same time. Each package keeps different users' KV caches and activations. The compiler schedules one weight stream per layer and lets each receiving package consume it in batch.
VALUE: Divides HBM weight-read energy per token by about 16 without SRAM-scale chip counts, making frontier MoE serving cheaper than either HBM-bound GPUs or SRAM-bound wafers.
